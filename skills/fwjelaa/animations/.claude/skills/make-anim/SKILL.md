name: make-anim
description: Makes a finished Roblox character animation (R6 or R15) with Blender or straight in Roblox Studio, from a reference clip, GIF or screenshots or from a description, checks it frame by frame and gets it playing in Studio (method by fwjelaa, FWJ STUDIOS). Use when the user sends or names a reference of a move (video, GIF, pictures) or asks for a Roblox animation (run, walk, idle, punch, M1 combo, kick, sword/spear slash, block, parry, dash, hit reaction, special, ultimate, emote), or types /make-anim.

# Make a Roblox animation

**A reference came with the request** (a clip, a GIF, screenshots, or a path to one)? Follow
**"When the user sends a reference"** in `CLAUDE.md`: timing sheet with `python kit/run.py ref`, study the
phases and poses, build, then `python kit/run.py compare` until it matches, then the checks and Studio steps.

**Just a description?** Follow **"When the user asks for an animation"** in `CLAUDE.md`.

Either way use its kit, pose language, timing cheat sheet, craft rules, quality bar and gotchas, and read
`anims/_lib.py`, `anims/_m1.py` and `anims/R6_Run.py` before writing your first animation. Anything typed after
`/make-anim` is the move and any notes ("weighty", "R15", "with a spear", "loop", a file path).

Pick the path from the tools you have: the Blender MCP (or Blender installed) → Path A; only the Roblox Studio MCP
→ Path B (Moon Animator 2). Work until the export prints `CHECKS: all clear` (deliberate strike smears aside),
the sheets (and the compare, for references) pass the quality bar from two angles, and, when Studio is connected,
`AnimKit.verify` prints `MATCHES BLENDER`. Then show the final sheet and tell the user how to watch it in Studio,
open it in Moon Animator 2, publish it and play it in their game.
